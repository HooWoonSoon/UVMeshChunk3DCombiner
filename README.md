This script is designed to create PBR texture voxel blocks. It is able to regenerate voxel blocks based on the UVmesh you draw in the tilemap. 
But one of the UV functions I don't have the time to clean up and convert into a functioning one. 
I found that no one on github has uploaded this concept, maybe OpenGL has it or I'm not good at searching and finding information, 
but I'm just offering it to others who may have the same goal as me which is to create an open world that also supports PBR texture mapping,
so hopefully this will be available for you to reference.
